## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you detect an 'exploitable' vulnerability in this codebase, please report it first to myself @zaeyx on twitter, or email at ben (at) soheicyber.com.

If you find something that might lead to a vulnerability, but you're not sure it's exploitable, please just open a new issue, and I'll take a look!
